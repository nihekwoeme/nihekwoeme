# Hey, I'm Amara 👋

Electrical engineering student passionate about computer and embedded systems. Essentially, I love working at the intersection of hardware and software, whether its firmware for microcontrollers or debeugging low level code.

## What I Work With

**Languages:** Python, C/C++, LEGv8 Assembly, Verilog  
**Embedded Platforms:** ESP32, Arduino, FPGA (Vivado)  
**Tools & Frameworks:** ROS2, OpenCV, MATLAB, AutoCAD, OnShape  
**Protocols:** I2C, SPI, UBX, RTCM

## Featured Projects

### RTK GPS Data Logger
A precision positioning system combining ESP32, ZED-F9P RTK GPS, cellular connectivity (SIM7000A), and SparkFun OpenLog Artemis. Achieves centimeter-level accuracy with real-time RTCM corrections and IMU sensor fusion. Includes MATLAB tools for GPS precision validation.

### Autonomous Vehicle Work
ROS2-based projects exploring perception and control for self-driving applications.
